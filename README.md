# rock-scissor-paper-game-js
Rock, paper, and scissors game is a simple fun game in which both the players have to make a rock, paper, or scissors. It has only two possible outcomes a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other player. 
I desgined the game using HTML, CSS and javaScript where the player will be playing against the computer. The player has to choose one option among the rock, paper, and scissors. A random option will be generated from the computerâ€™s side and the one who wins will get one point every time.
